What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git sets up a repository folder and begins tracking the contents of the folder. You need to set it up so that you can begin commiting files to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary that allows you to check your work before committing it. It's a good way to check for errors before adding a new commit to the repository, and potentially bloating it with back commits that are missing files, or have files that shouldn't be there.
